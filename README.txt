Thank you for your time and for giving me this opportunity to take a next step
in my life as a future developer.
I have run code locally on http-server and it works with no errors.
I apologize if code isnt organized or refractored.
I find angularjs very very pleasing to work with and it was a real challenge 
for me, working on something like this for the first time.
Thank you again and I hope we will hear again.

Best regards

Samir Sakanovic :)
